## What is this?

The-template is a high amount of my developer skills wrapped up in one application: a social media site where you can create AI generated prompts and share the pictures socially. I will also be hosting special tutorials to how to create many AI applications.

## Login

For now you can login in with Google, I plan to add others, such as GitHub, in the future.

## Future Plans

I want to create an area for short story or poem writers to share stories based off their AI generated picture, read a great story and having it shared with an image is great.
