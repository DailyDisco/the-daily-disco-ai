## What is this?
The-template is a high amount of my developer skills wrapped up in one application: a social media site where you can create AI generated prompts and share the pictures socially. I will also be hosting special tutorials to how to create many AI applications.

## Login
For now you can login in with Google, I plan to add others, such as GitHub, in the future.

## Future Plans
I want to create an area for short story or poem writers to share stories based off their AI generated picture, read a great story and having it shared with an image is great.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Do "npm install"
Run "npm run dev"

The browser should now open on localhost.
